# Depression Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to detect depression using machine learning techniques. The model employs an ensemble hybrid approach to train on real-time data, providing highly accurate predictions. Additionally, the project includes a feature for detecting depression through face detection.

## Key Features

- **Ensemble Hybrid Model**: Combines multiple machine learning models to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Real-time Data**: Utilizes real-time data for training and predictions.
- **Face Detection**: Includes an additional feature to detect depression using facial expressions.
- **High Accuracy**: The model has demonstrated very accurate results in detecting depression.
- **Website**: Developed a website using Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

## Research Paper and Presentation

This project has been documented in a research paper and presented at the ICRCET conference. The research paper provides detailed insights into the methodology and results of the project.
